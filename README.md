# React Native Pixel
A mobile application (iOS, Android) developed using React Native, which lists different personal profiles and their images. This project was undertaken to familiarize myself with React.

## Description
This application, built with React Native, showcases a catalog of profiles, each featuring a profile picture, name, age, and a gallery of photos. Users can browse through the profiles and view the images associated with each.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idontwannafailmyexam/pixel.git
   cd pixel
   ```
## Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## Running the App
To run the app, you can use either a mobile emulator or Expo CLI.


### Using an Emulator
Follow the instructions in the React Native documentation to set up an emulator:

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
After setting up the emulator, run the app:

```bash
npx react-native run-android # For Android
npx react-native run-ios # For iOS (requires a MacOS computer)
```
## Using Expo CLI
Alternatively, you can use Expo CLI to run the app on your physical device or an emulator. First, install Expo CLI:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Then, start the app
```bash
expo start
```

## For more details on using Expo CLI, visit the Expo CLI documentation.
